## For better  development and support, Summer Boot's product line will be divided into the following two:
1. Proprietary: âœ¨Summer Boot Servicesâœ¨ will continue to be supported by summerboot.org and focus on legal or other business related services
2. Open source: âœ¨Summer Boot jExpressâœ¨ (a.k.a. Summer Boot Framework Core) will be supported by jExpress.org and focus on non-business operation and maintenance infrastructure functions, and serve as a rapid development framework for Summer Boot Services.
